                            <p class="card-text px-4 pb-4">The first two peaks have a height of more than 7000 m, and the height of Pushkin Peak is 5100 m. The flat top of the mountains is called plateau-like. There is such a peak in the southern part of the Rocky Mountains - this is the Front Range, the highest point of which is Mount Grace Peak (4349 m). The eastern slopes of the mountain are gentle, while the western slopes are steep. The second example is the Khibiny, whose peaks are plateau-like, and the slopes are steep, with separate snowfields, although no glaciers were found in the Khibiny. The highest point of the Khibiny rises to 1200.6 m - this is Mount Yudychvumchorr. Flat tops are also characteristic of the table mountains in Ethiopia - the Amba Mountains. Table mountains are a type of plateau mountains. Table mountains have a truncated flat top, steep or stepped slopes. Their occurrence is associated with the activity of flowing waters during the dismemberment of stratal plains, for example, the Turgai plateau. Examples of table mountains are the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in Germany, Ben-Balben in Ireland, Szczelinec the Great in Poland, Monument Valley in the USA, Table Mountain in the Caucasus, Table Mountain in South Africa, etc. A number of mountain systems are domed, i.e. rounded tops. Such peaks may have ancient extinct and heavily destroyed volcanoes. The Black Hills in the USA has such a peak. During the dome uplift, the central core was exposed, consisting of igneous and metamorphic rocks. A domed mountain on the southern coast of the Crimean peninsula - Mount Ayu-Dag or Bear Mountain. Its height is 577 m above sea level. The mountain is a classic example of a laccolith. In the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters there is a remnant magmatic mountain-laccolith - Mashuk, 993.7 m high with a regular domed shape.</p>
